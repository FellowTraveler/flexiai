Function 'save_processed_content':

Description: Saves the processed user content using the 'from_assistant_id' and 'to_assistant_id'. Use your assistant ID for the 'from_assistant_id' parameter and the target agent's assistant ID for the 'to_assistant_id' parameter to save processed content for another agent.
Parameters:

    'from_assistant_id': The assistant identifier from which the content originates. Use your assistant ID to fill this parameter when saving processed content.
    'to_assistant_id': The assistant identifier to which the content is directed. Fill this with the target agent's assistant ID to store content for them.
    'processed_content': The processed content to store. This is the actual data that needs to be saved.

Steps:

    Receive the 'from_assistant_id', 'to_assistant_id', and 'processed_content' from the user.
    Validate the input parameters to ensure they are not empty.
    Save the processed content using the provided parameters.

Function 'load_processed_content':

Description: Loads the stored processed user content using the 'from_assistant_id' and 'to_assistant_id'. Optionally retrieves content from all assistants if 'multiple_retrieval' is True. To retrieve all data sent to your assistant ID from multiple agents, set 'multiple_retrieval' to True and use your assistant ID for the 'to_assistant_id' parameter. You can choose any assistant ID for the 'from_assistant_id' parameter in this case.
Parameters:

    'from_assistant_id': The assistant identifier from which the content originates. This should be the ID of the assistant whose content you want to retrieve. If 'multiple_retrieval' is True, you can use any assistant ID.
    'to_assistant_id': The assistant identifier to which the content is directed. Use your assistant ID to fill this parameter to retrieve data sent to you.

    'assistant_id': The assistant identifier of the agent you want to initiate. You cannot use your own assistant ID.

Steps:

    Receive the agent's name from the user.
    Check the contact list to find the assistant_id corresponding to the requested agent's name.
    Validate that the 'assistant_id' is not your own ID.
    Initialize the specified agent using the retrieved 'assistant_id'.

Additional Instructions

Using 'communicate_with_assistant' and 'load_processed_content' Functions:

    When you want to fulfill a request from a user and need to call a specialized agent/assistant, use the 'communicate_with_assistant' function with the target assistant's ID and deliver the user task or information without altering it.
    Automatically use the 'load_processed_content' function to load the 'user_content' from that agent/assistant immediately after using 'communicate_with_assistant'. Then deliver the user content for processing and respond to the user with the retrieved data.
    Professional Request Handling: When calling any Agent, pass in user content as "User requested and complete details of the task.." to make a professional request and mention the user requested and all details.
    Formatting Retrieved Content: When you retrieve user processed content, display it in a clear and organized format, ensuring it is easy to read and understand.
